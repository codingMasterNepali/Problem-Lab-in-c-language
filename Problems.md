1.Write a C program that declares an integer variable and assigns a value to it. Display the     
  value of the variable on the screen using printf() function.

2.Write a C program that asks the user to input two integer values, adds them together, and  
  displays the result on the screen.

3.Write a C program that uses a for loop to display the numbers from 1 to 10 on the screen.Declare an integer variable and use it as the counter variable for the loop.

4.Write a C program that declares two integer variables and swaps their values   
  using  a temporary variable. Display the original values and the swapped values on the screen.===>> exchanging the values of two variable

5.Write a C program that asks the user to input an integer value and displays whether it is even 
  or odd. Use the modulus operator (%) to determine whether the value is even or odd.

1.	Write a program that takes two integer inputs from the user and displays 
    the result of their addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2.	Write a program that takes an integer input from the user and determines 
    whether it is even or odd using the modulus operator.

3.	Write a program that takes three integer inputs from the user and calculates 
    the average of those numbers using the arithmetic operators.

4.	Write a program that takes a character input from the user and determines 
    whether it is an alphabet or a digit using logical operators.

5.	Write a program that takes a floating-point number input from the user and 
    rounds it to the nearest integer using the round function.

6.	Write a program that takes two integer inputs from the user and swaps their 
    values using bitwise operators.

7.	Write a program that takes an integer input from the user and determines whether 
    it is a prime number or not using logical and arithmetic operators.

8.	Write a program that takes a string input from the user and converts it to all 
    uppercase using the toupper function.

9.	Write a program that takes an integer input from the user and displays its binary 
    equivalent using bitwise operators.

10.	Write a program that takes two floating-point inputs from the user and determines 
    whether they are equal up to a certain decimal point precision using the epsilon constant.
